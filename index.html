            No affiliation with any NGOs: we dream, we plan & we execute all by ourselves!</p></h4>
          <h3>Some initiatives</h3>
            <p><h4> (a) <strong>You Treat They Feast (2009 - present)</strong> - an initiative where food and general supplies are collected and distributed among-st the ones who really need them. We have done 12 such drives for daily wage laborers, farmers, policemen, pavement dwellers, street kids etc.
              <a href="https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/other/diwali-do-gooders/articleshow/15963559.cms"><img class="MM-img" src="images/MM.png" alt="MM image"></h4></a>
            <h4> (b) <strong>You Vote We Transport (2010 | 2014 | 2019)</strong> - Recognizing the fact that voting is important and a birth right we volunteered to ferry senior | differently abled citizens from their residence to the designated polling booths. In the last three general elections we have supported more than 35 citizens to exercise their voting rights and as this initiative was widely covered by media and radio channels, we hope to have inspired thousands of youth to vote as well.

            </h4>
            <h4> (c) <strong>Loose the Blame and Support the game (2010)</strong> – This Commonwealth Games initiative was to help shift focus from the negativity due to corruption claims and focus on the Indian athletes. This was a world stage event and didn’t want our country’s name tarnished.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U780Ehv2xY"><img class="NDTV-img" src="images/NDTV.png" alt="NDTV image"></h4></a>
            <h4> (d) <strong>Jan Gan Man (2015)</strong> – We hold a national record, documented by the Limca Books of Awards, for having the maximum recital of the Indian national anthem on a single day with a large crowd across 20 different locations.
            <a href="https://www.coca-colaindia.com/stories/travelling-national-anthem-recitals"><img class="LR-img" src="images/LR.png" alt="LR image"></h4></a>
            <h4> (e) <strong>Jal Save-a (2016-17)</strong> – When we were made aware of the plight of villagers and farmers due to severe drought in the village of Vashala, we crowd funded enough money to help them dig two borewells. This has made the entire village of 350+ families self-reliant for years to come.</h4>
            <h4> (f) <strong>Rebuild a Path-shalla (2018-19)</strong> – This was an effort to rebuild a school and its pathway for a village in Shahpur district, Maharashtra. We manage to restore the entire school with wall work, roof tiling, toilets, classroom furniture and accessories and the path leading to the school (which was extremely treacherous during rains and even otherwise)</h4></p>
